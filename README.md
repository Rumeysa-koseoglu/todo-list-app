# Todo List App

This is a mini Todo List application created using React, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript. You can add tasks, delete them, or edit them if you've made a spelling mistake. Once you've completed a task, you can click on it to mark it as done. This app makes it easier to manage your to-do items and stay organized
